# Web Scrapping - Realtor Data

Technology used: *JavaScript, Excel*


I just found a good data source of realtors in Canada. I decided to use JavaScript to try to extract data and create a dataset with all realtor information in Canada.

## JavaScript file
The address file is also derived from scraping some private websites.
The whole web scraping process was performed using the Puppeteer library [*scraping.js*](https://github.com/Kushh37/Web-Scrapping-and-Automation-Bots/blob/main/scrapping.js).

## Output

Output file in form dataset as .xlsx file [*output.xlsx*](https://github.com/Kushh37/Web-Scrapping-and-Automation-Bots/blob/main/output.xlsx).

The newly created dataset was used for business purposes.
